# <i>Undecided?</i> Companion App

Developed using <a href="https://onsen.io/">Onsen UI</a>, an HTML5 framework, and JavaScript


To help with facilitating <i><a href="https://ppig.org/files/2020-PPIG-31st-becker.pdf">Undecided?</a></i>, an educational board game that teaches people about the ins and outs of software development, I've developed an app that automates as much of the facilitation process as possible.

## Accessing the App
On a mobile device, visit https://enviroprogrammer.github.io/ud-app/ in your favourite browser. You could also access the app from a computer, but it is optimized for mobile.
