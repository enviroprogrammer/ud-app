# <i>Undecided?</i> Companion App

Developed using <a href="https://onsen.io/">Onsen UI</a>, an HTML5 framework, and JavaScript


To help with facilitating <i><a href="https://ppig.org/files/2020-PPIG-31st-becker.pdf">Undecided?</a></i>, an educational board game that teaches people about the ins and outs of software development, I've developed an app that automates as much of the facilitation process as possible. This reduces the need for a human facilitator so that they can simultaneously play the game.

## Accessing the App
On a mobile device, visit https://enviroprogrammer.github.io/ud-app/ in your favourite browser. You could also access the app from a computer, but it is optimized for mobile.


Did you know that you could install the app directly to your phone or tablet, too? Read the section below to find out how!

## Installing the App to a Mobile Device
This app is a <b><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/What_is_a_progressive_web_app">Progressive Web App (PWA)</a></b>, meaning that it is a web app that behaves exactly like a typical mobile app. In other words, you can install PWAs to your device straight from the browser. PWAs can also be accessed offline.

Below are instructions on how to install this app on either iOS or Android.

### iOS

1. Open the app in Safari.
